      <h2>Personal Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        When you visit RedBlue Academy, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including details about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the website, we collect information about the individual web pages or products you view, the websites or search terms that referred you to our site, and how you interact with the website. We refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information." Moreover, we may collect personal data you provide to us (including, but not limited to, your name, surname, address, payment information, etc.) during registration in order to fulfill an agreement.

      <h2>Why Do We Process Your Data?</h2>
      <p>
        Our top priority is customer data security, and as such, we may only process minimal user data, solely as necessary to maintain the website. The automatically-collected information is used only to identify potential cases of misuse and to compile statistical data regarding website usage. These statistical data are not aggregated in a way that would identify any particular user.

However, if you wish to use certain website features, subscribe to our newsletter, or provide other information by filling out a form, you may provide personal data such as your email, first name, last name, city, organization, and phone number. You may choose not to provide us with your personal data, but this may result in your inability to use some features of the website. For example, you won't be able to receive our newsletter or contact us directly via the website. Users unsure about which information is mandatory are welcome to contact us at <strong>info@redblueacademy.com</strong>.
